# MailchimpDashboard
This is the platform where user able to retrieve the information from Mailchimp and display in the form of chart.

This is my first ReactJs project.

# Aim
The purpose of building this dashboard is to let solve the problem of visualizing the Mailchimp time series chart. In Mailchimp insight, we are unable to see the trend/pattern of the subscribe/unsubscribed contact or how the campaign performance in recent 7 days.

Through this dashboard, the user able to see gain some insight from the time series chart.

There are two main folders, which are frontend and backend.
